# 1. Introduction
Movie rental Data Analysis.<br />
Answer business intelligence (BI) questions by cleaning and querying Data sets with PreSQL, creating a data dictionary and finally present findings.


# 2. Business understanding
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the
world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime,
the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

## Key questions and objectives
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and
they expect data-driven answers which they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are
the main questions theyâ€™d l ike to answer:

Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
* What was the average rental duration for all videos
* Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
* Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
* Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

# 3. Data understanding

## Data set
The rational database used for this project contains 15 tables which are connected to eachother over a private key and/or foreign key.
This data set contains information about Rockbusters' film inventory, customers, payments and more.
[Rockbuster data set](</dvdrental.zip>)

## Data structure
The data structure at hand is setup as a snowflake schema. There is one fact table "payment" which has many dimension tables like "rental", "store", "customer" and "staff".
These dimension tables are connected to sub dimension tables like "film_actor","film_category", "category" and so on.
For a more detailed perspective please see below the ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) which was extracted with Postgres pgAdmin.

With the data dictionary all data types, tables and their relationship to eachother can be identified.</br >

## Tools
For this project the following tools were used
* PostgreSQL
* Tableau

# 4. Data preperation
To prepare the data properly for visualization we need to follow the following steps: Extract, transform, load into new database (in this case it will be to export the data into csv for visualization purposes)

## Cleaning and summarizing

### Find duplicated data in "film" table
```SQL
SELECT film_id,
		title,
		description,
		rating,
		COUNT(*)
FROM film
GROUP BY film_id,
		title,
		description,
		rating
HAVING COUNT(*)>1
```
No duplicated data was found.

### Find missing data
```SQL
SELECT customer_id,
		store_id,
		first_name,
		last_name,
		email,
		address_id,
		activebool,
		create_date,
		last_update,
		active
		
FROM customer
Where (customer_id,
		store_id,
		first_name,
		last_name,
		email,
		address_id,
		activebool,
		create_date,
		last_update,
		active) is NULL
```
No missing data was found.

# 5. Analysis

## Descriptive Analysis

First extract some key data for the final presentation to give the audience a feel of the data set and what it holds.
Extract the following:
* Count of all available movies
* MIN, MAX and AVERAGE of the following:</br >
&emsp;&emsp;- year of release</br >
&emsp;&emsp;- Rental duration</br >
&emsp;&emsp;- Rental rate</br >
&emsp;&emsp;- Movie length in minutes</br >
&emsp;&emsp;- replacement costs</br >
```SQL
--query MIN,MAX, AVG and count of movies
SELECT
	COUNT(film_id) AS count_of_movies,
	MAX(film_id) AS highest_film_id,
	
	MIN(release_year) AS MIN_release_year,
	MAX(release_year) AS MAX_release_year,
	AVG(release_year) AS AVG_release_year,
	
	MIN(rental_duration) AS MIN_rental_duration,
	MAX(rental_duration) AS MAX_rental_duration,
	AVG(rental_duration) AS AVG_rental_duration,
	
	MIN(rental_rate) AS MIN_rental_rate,
	MAX(rental_rate) AS MAX_rental_rate,
	AVG(rental_rate) AS AVG_rental_rate,
	
	MIN(length) AS MIN_length,
	MAX(length) AS MAX_length,
	AVG(length) AS AVG_length,
	
	MIN(replacement_cost) AS MIN_replacement_cost,
	MAX(replacement_cost) AS MAX_replacement_cost,
	AVG(replacement_cost) AS AVG_replacement_cost
	
FROM film
```

Most common language and PG rating
```SQL
SELECT 	MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY language_id) AS most_common_language_id,
		 MODE() WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY rating) AS most_common_rating

FROM film;
```
Most common language_id is 1 which stands for English language. And most common rating is PG-13.

### Join examples

Extract data about the movies which produce the most revenue
```SQL
--extract movies with the most revenue by join rental, inventory and film and sum the amount
SELECT title,
       SUM(amount) AS total_payment
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN rental B ON A.rental_id = B.rental_id
INNER JOIN inventory C ON B.inventory_id = C.inventory_id
INNER JOIN film D ON C.film_id = D.film_id

GROUP BY title
ORDER BY total_payment DESC
```

Where are customers with a high value based.
```SQL
--Customers with a high value from which country
SELECT country,
       COUNT(A.customer_id) AS customer_count,
       SUM(amount) AS total_payment
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id = D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_ID = E.country_ID

GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total_payment DESC
```

Top 5 customers of the TOP 10 countries
```SQL
SELECT 	B.customer_id,
	B.first_name,
	B.last_name,
	D.city,
	E.country,
	SUM(A.amount) as total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id =D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id

WHERE D.city IN ( 	Select D.city
			FROM customer B
			INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
			INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id =D.city_id
			INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
			WHERE E.country IN ( 	SELECT E.country
						FROM customer B
						INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
						INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id =D.city_id
						INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
						GROUP BY country
						ORDER BY COUNT(customer_id) DESC
						LIMIT 10
						)
					GROUP BY country, city
					ORDER BY COUNT(customer_id) DESC
					LIMIT 10
		)
Group by 	B.customer_id,
		B.first_name,
		B.last_name,
		D.city,
		E.country
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5
```

### Subqueries examples
Find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers
```SQL
SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid) AS average_amount_paid
FROM (SELECT 	B.customer_id,
		B.first_name,
		B.last_name,
		D.city,
		E.country,
		SUM(A.amount) as total_amount_paid
FROM payment A
INNER JOIN customer B ON A.customer_id = B.customer_id
INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id =D.city_id
INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id

WHERE D.city IN (	Select D.city
				FROM customer B
				INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
				INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id =D.city_id
				INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
				WHERE E.country IN (	SELECT E.country
						FROM customer B
						INNER JOIN address C ON B.address_id = C.address_id
						INNER JOIN city D ON C.city_id =D.city_id
						INNER JOIN country E ON D.country_id = E.country_id
						GROUP BY country
						ORDER BY COUNT(customer_id) DESC
						LIMIT 10
				 		)
	 			GROUP BY country, city
				ORDER BY COUNT(customer_id) DESC
				LIMIT 10
				)
Group by 	B.customer_id,
	B.first_name,
	B.last_name,
	D.city,
	E.country
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid
```
The average amoint paid by the TOP 5 customers is 105.55
